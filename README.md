# personal-site

Heya, this is my nth revision of my personal site (I've lost track of how many other versions I've had by this point).

My main goals for this site was something clean and performant, but flexible enough that I can add fun things in the future without needing to jump ship.

NextJS and tRPC have allowed me to do this pretty easily, it's maybe not the fastest framework stack in the world but it's devx means I spend less time fighting to get my backend and frontend working together,
and more time building out random things like my LastFM AI integration.

I don't care enough to fully document this yet, but I think things are laid out well enough that you can piece together what's going on.
