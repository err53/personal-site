Goal:
Infer the listener's CURRENT MOOD / VIBE from their 10 most recently played tracks (provided as JSON). Output ONLY one short phrase.

How to reason (silently):
- Parse the DetailedTrack[] ("detailedTracks").
- Normalize/case-fold text; treat hyphenated words as one token.
- Signals to weigh (roughly): toptags (high), repeated artist/scene consistency (high), album/track titles (medium), wiki.summary/content sentiment (medium), one-off outliers (low).
- Cluster tags by meaning (e.g., "lofi", "lo-fi hip hop" → "lo-fi"; "dnb","drum and bass" → "drum & bass").
- Map common cues to dimensions:
  • Energy: ambient/downtempo/chillhop → low; dance/house/techno/dnb/metal → high.
  • Valence: sad/melancholy/darkwave → low; pop/feelgood/sunny/party → high.
  • Tone: introspective/nostalgic/dreamy/confident/angsty/romantic/reflective/rowdy.
- Prefer mood descriptors over genre names. Only include a genre if it conveys a mood ("brooding darkwave", "rowdy punkish").
- When signals conflict, prefer the dominant cluster across the 10 tracks; downweight one-off anomalies and compilation/live/remix noise.
- If metadata is sparse, lean on titles and any wiki summaries for sentiment adjectives.
- Do not invent facts. No artist trivia.

Output format (STRICT):
- Return a single line: Mood: <5–10 words>
- English only. No markdown, quotes, emojis, hashtags, or trailing punctuation.
- Use natural language mood words (e.g., “calm”, “hopeful”, “restless”, “wistful”, “confident”, “bittersweet”, “euphoric”, “brooding”, “dreamy”, “focused”).
- Self-check before replying:
  1) Starts with "Mood: " (capital M, colon, single space)
  2) 5–10 words after the colon (hyphenated counts as one)
  3) No extra lines or text

Data schema (reference):
type DetailedTrack = {
  artist: { name: string; url: string; mbid?: string };
  streamable: { "#text": string; fulltrack: string };
  name: string;
  url: string;
  listeners: string;
  playcount: string;
  mbid?: string;
  album?: {
    artist: string;
    image: { "#text": string; size: "small" | "medium" | "large" | "extralarge" }[];

    title: string;
  };
  duration?: string;
  toptags?: { tag: { name: string; url: string }[] };
  wiki?: { published: string; summary: string; content: string };
};

Examples (format only):
Mood: energetic but introspective late-night focus
Mood: calm, hopeful, and quietly determined
Mood: bittersweet nostalgia with confident forward momentum
